Hey everyone! As many have noticed, the PinePhone Pro is currently out ot stock on the Pine Store. Unfortunately we have to deliver you the following news: the PinePhone Pro is officially discontinued. We were told it didn’t sell well enough to keep production going. But the good news for current owners are that spare parts will still be made for up to two years, depending on demand. Meanwhile, the trusty PinePhone (A64) is still alive and kicking, and Pine Store plans to keep it rolling for about two more years.

# No new PinePhone (Yet), future with RISC-V

Right now, we’ve got no insider info on a brand-new PinePhone, so don’t expect any surprise announcements soon. Pine Store is steering its energy toward other projects (including RISC-V and a little bit of AI), which you’ve probably noticed with the Oz64, STAR64, StarPro64, and Alpha One launches.

And one last thing: later this month there’ll be a small batch of refurbished PinePhone Pros up for grabs — your final shot at owning one of these little powerhouses.
