This page contains a list of all available operating systems for the [Quartz64](/documentation/Quartz64) in alphabetical order, as well as links to other resources.

## Software releases

{{< admonition type="warning" >}}
 You are strongly encouraged to procure a 3.3V UART serial adapter capable of running at 1.5 mbauds, such as [the Woodpecker](https://pine64.com/product/serial-console-woodpecker-edition/) if you want to use a Quartz64, as some images' U-Boot may have no video output on this chip.
{{</ admonition >}}

{{< admonition type="important" >}}
 **Note:** The images are provided by the community, not by PINE64. Most community projects currently aim at getting mainline Linux running on the board, not some vendor provided kernel that will never be receiving updates. A mainline-first approach allows for the boards to continue receiving important updates, such as security updates, for years to come, as well as have higher quality code in the kernel as it underwent independent review, but does mean that not all aspects of the hardware work right out of the gate.

### Armbian

{{< figure src="/documentation/images/armbian.png" width="100" >}}

**Armbian** is a base operating system platform for single board computers

* Lightweight Debian or Ubuntu based Linux distribution specialized for ARM development boards
* Each system is compiled, assembled and optimized by [Armbian Build Tools](https://github.com/armbian/build)
* It has powerful build and software development tools to make custom builds

Download:

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
 This image appears to have issues detecting more than 2GB of RAM. It is strongly recommended to use a different distribution.
{{</ admonition >}}

* [latest, as fresh as possible, upon code change, images](https://github.com/armbian/build/releases/)

Notes:

* Support on Armbian forums https://forum.armbian.com/forum/96-upcoming-hardware-wip/

### DietPi

{{< figure src="/documentation/images/dietpi.png" width="100" >}}

### Manjaro ARM

{{< figure src="/documentation/images/Manjaro-logo.svg" width="100" >}}

**Manjaro ARM** is a user friendly rolling release distribution, based on Arch Linux ARM.

Download:

* Quartz64 Model A: [Image on GitHub](https://github.com/manjaro-arm/quartz64-a-images/releases)
* Quartz64 Model B: [Image on GitHub](https://github.com/manjaro-arm/quartz64-b-images/releases)

Notes:

Most of the hardware support is already available in the mainline kernel. If some devices doesn’t work it is possible to swap to the linux-quartz64 kernel `pacman -S linux-quartz64`.

Following desktop options available:

* Gnome
* KDE Plasma
* Mate
* Sway
* XFCE
as well as minimal image without desktop.

### NetBSD

**NetBSD** is a free, fast, secure, and highly portable Unix-like Open Source operating system. It relies upon the UEFI support in Tianocore. Before NetBSD 10 is released, the latest version of NetBSD-current should be used.

Download:

* [NetBSD daily builds top level](https://nycdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD-daily/HEAD/) from inside here, navigate to a date, and inside the images/ subdirectory are installable images. Use the one called "NetBSD-<version>-evbarm-aarch64-install.img.gz".

Notes:

* This image can be written to a supported device, such as the eMMC interface, any USB storage device, NVMe, and PCIe AHCI SATA are all supported with builds after 2022-01-15.
* Currently this can not be shared with the EDK2 port, ie, microSD for EDK2 and some other media for NetBSD.

### Plebian

Plebian stands for **P*INE64 *L*ive D*ebian** and aims to be a fairly vanilla live Debian image for Quartz64 and SOQuartz devices, based on Debian Bookworm.

* [Download Release Images](https://github.com/Plebian-Linux/quartz64-images/releases)
* [Read The Instructions](https://github.com/Plebian-Linux/quartz64-images/blob/main/RUNNING.md)
* [Visit plebian.org to learn more](https://plebian.org/)

To flash, run (replace _/dev/sdX_ with your target block device):

```console
$ xzcat imagename.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=4M oflag=dsync status=progress
```

Some quick notes:

* You will be asked to change your password on first login (for what the default login is, read the instructions)
* Root file system is grown to take up the entire space of your boot device
* NetworkManager is used instead of Debian’s interfaces config to be more flexible with what adapters are plugged in and working
* An sshd is started on port 22 with freshly generated keys

### Tianocore EDK II port by jmcneill

This (as of 2021-12-30) is a work in progress to enable UEFI enabled systems, and is able to bring up SD, eMMC, USB, PCIe with SATA and NVMe, HDMI, thermal sensors, TRNG, as well as general Cortex A-55 features. Known to work with NetBSD -current, and the ESXi Arm fling version 1.8.

Download:

* [jmcneill’s Quartz64 UEFI Github](https://github.com/jaredmcneill/quartz64_uefi)

Notes:

* The microSD card image should be written to an microSD card and installed. Currently, using the same card for the operating system as well may be problematic.
