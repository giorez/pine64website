The following releases are available for the [PineNote](/documentation/PineNote).

## Factory-installed Images

### Summary

* Pre-2024 PineNotes were not shipped with a working linux installation.
* Batch-2 (Community Edition) PineNotes that started selling in October 2024 were shipped with the community-maintained, Debian-based, Linux image found here: [https://github.com/PNDeb/pinenote-debian-image](https://github.com/PNDeb/pinenote-debian-image).
* While the factory-flashed image cannot be freely distributed due to unclear distribution rights of the waveform, OS files without the shipped waveforms can be found in this release and a basically equivalent to the shipped images: https://github.com/PNDeb/pinenote-debian-image/releases/tag/batch-2-factory-image-wo-waveform
* Parts of the batch-2 PineNotes will be flashed with an updated OS version. Notes regarding differentiating between factory OS versions will be made available here in time.

## Debian

* A full GNOME-enabled rootfs/disc image is provided under [PNDeb/pinenote-debian-image/releases](https://github.com/PNDeb/pinenote-debian-image/releases). This image can be flashed using rkdeveloptool.

* A Debian-based minimalistic rootfs/disc image can be built using `debos` using the work from [Eugen Răhăian](https://salsa.debian.org/eugenrh). The GNOME image above is building on this work.
