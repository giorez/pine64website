The PineTab-V is an experimental device and lacks dedicated working software â€“ it should therefore only be purchased by people interested in helping with the bring-up process of Linux and BSDs on the RISC-V architecture. 

The second batch released in 2025 includes a Debian "Bookworm/Sid" operating system created by StarFive. This build includes a lot of old packages and has a snapshot date of 2022/12/25. It is recommended to be used for development purposes only. 

{{< admonition type="warning" >}}
 Do not buy the device unless you intend to use it for operating system development purposes.
