The Pinephone’s triple for cross-compiling is `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`.

## C/++

### Installing the Toolchain

{{< admonition type="important" >}}
 Please add instructions for other distributions to this section if you know them!
{{</ admonition >}}

First, you’ll need to install the gcc cross-compilation toolchain.

#### On Arch Linux

```Shell
$ sudo pacman -S aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc
```

#### On Ubuntu/Debian

```Shell
$ sudo apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
```

#### On Void Linux

```Shell
$ sudo xbps-install cross-aarch64-linux-gnu
```

### Using the Toolchain

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
If you are trying to build an Arch Linux package with `makepkg`, also make sure to `export CARCH=aarch64`.
{{</ admonition >}}

#### GNU Make

##### Kernel Makefile

For each invocation of `make`, be sure to pass the options `ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-` like this:

```Shell
$ make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
```

##### Other

If you are using a handwritten Makefile (not autogenerated by a meta-buildsystem such as meson, automake, etc.) then simply override `CC` and `LD` as you need.

#### automake

```Shell
$ ./configure --host=aarch64-linux-gnu
```

#### meson

See [the official meson documentation](https://mesonbuild.com/Cross-compilation.html) on the topic. In general, the introduction is a good read for any cross-compiling novice.

## Rust

In order to cross-compile Rust applications for the PinePhone, you need to have a gcc cross-compiler installed and the Rust dependencies, usually the std crate, cross compiled for the target system. A more extensive explanation can be found on https://github.com/japaric/rust-cross. This instruction is based on it’s description.

### Installing a GCC Cross-Compiler

The cross-compiler might have a different name depending on the operating system. Further along this instruction the name for the gcc cross-compiler will be used. Replace all occurrences of `$gcc_name` with the name on your distribution.

For how to install the gcc cross-compilation toolchain on your distribution, please see [Cross-compiling](/documentation/General/Cross-compiling#installing_the_toolchain)

### Installing Rust Dependencies

The necessary dependencies can easily be installed with rustup:

```Shell
$ rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

OR it can be installed with multirust [Is this still accurate???]:

```Shell
$ multirust add-target nightly aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

### Compiling

#### rustc

When using rustc just add the two flags --target=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu and -C linker=$gcc_name. Under Arch, this would look like:

```Shell
$ rustc --target=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu -C linker=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc main.rs
```

To test it, run the program on your PinePhone

```Shell
$ scp main user@ipadress:/home/user/Downloads
$ ssh user@ipadress /home/user/Downloads/main
Hello, world!
```

#### cargo

To cross-compile a project with cargo, open the folder of the project in a terminal. Then create a new folder and a file for cargo.

```Shell
$ mkdir .cargo
$ cat >.cargo/config <<EOF
> [target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu]
> linker = "$gcc_name"
> EOF
```

Then you can compile it with

```Shell
$ cargo build --target=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

To test it, copy the file on your PinePhone

```Shell
$ scp target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/main user@ipadress:/home/user/Downloads
```

Then you can execute it by

```Shell
$ ssh user@ipadress ./main -h
Hello, world!
```

### Possible Errors

If you encounter an error saying

    Cross compilation detected. Use PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_CROSS=1 to override

just add that variable in front of your command e.g.

    PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_CROSS=1 cargo build --target=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
