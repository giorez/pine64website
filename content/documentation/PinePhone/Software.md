#### Notes

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
Note about zstd archive file (`.zst`):

On Linux, you may install or compile `zstd`, then write the image to SD card by piping `zstdcat` and `dd`. See the "Installation" section of its [web page](https://xnux.eu/p-boot-demo/) for command examples.

On Windows, instead of the offical [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) command line program, you may use [7-zip-zstd](https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd). Different installation method is provided in their README. Install 7-Zip-zstd / zstd, extract the disk image file (`.img`) from the zstd archive, and flash with tools like [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/).

Also see [Installation instructions](/documentation/PinePhone/Installation_instructions).

### openSUSE

{{< figure src="/documentation/images/SLEM-OS-logo.png" width="100" >}}

Our images use the same [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) base as our desktop images,
except what needs to be changed for the PinePhone.
The images include _zypper_ (RPM) as the default package manager,
and have access to virtually the same (open source) software as our desktop repositories,
thanks to the [Factory](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory) ports.
Using [dnf](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:DNF) is possible, if preferred.

#### Download

* [Phosh](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/ARM:/Factory:/Contrib:/PinePhone/images/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-ARM-PHOSH-pinephone.aarch64.raw.xz) / [SHA-256](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/ARM:/Factory:/Contrib:/PinePhone/images/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-ARM-PHOSH-pinephone.aarch64.raw.xz.sha256) / [SHA-256 Signature](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/ARM:/Factory:/Contrib:/PinePhone/images/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-ARM-PHOSH-pinephone.aarch64.raw.xz.sha256.asc)

### Sailfish OS

{{< figure src="/documentation/images/SailfishOS_logo.png" width="100" >}}

[Sailfish OS](https://sailfishos.org/) is a Linux-based operating system based on open source projects such as [Mer](https://wiki.merproject.org/wiki/Main_Page), and a closed source UI based on [Lipstick](https://sailfishos.org/wiki/Lipstick).

* [PinePhone Wiki Page](https://wiki.merproject.org/wiki/Adaptations/PinePhone64) on Mer Wiki, for both Nemo Mobile and Sailfish OS.
* [Linux kernel config repo](https://gitlab.com/pinephone-sailfish-os/linux-kernel/)
* [Sailfish OS repo](https://gitlab.com/sailfishos-porters-ci/dont_be_evil-ci/)

#### Download

*Flashing script*

The Sailfish OS image is built on Gitlab CI. The latest image can be installed using the [flashing script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sailfish-on-dontbeevil/flash-it/master/flash-it.sh).

The script downloads the image and bootloader from the CI, extracts everything and burns it onto the SD card.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
 The script will format and erase the SD card!
{{< /admonition >}}

Instructions:

1. Download the flashing script
2. Insert a microSD card in your device
3. Make the script executable: `chmod +x flash-it.sh`
4. Verify that you have the `bsdtar` package installed
5. Execute it: `./flash-it.sh`
6. Follow the instructions. Some commands in the script require root permissions (for example: mounting and flashing the SD card).

When asked where to flash, type 'raw' and it will build the image on your computer. Otherwise define the path */dev/[...]*. to flash to card or internal emmc.

*username/password*

Set PIN on initialization.

#### Notes

* Sometimes the first run stalls before the tutorial. Reboot and it will start from setting the security pin.
* The homescreen may be locked unless you boot with a sim card inserted. An old expired sim will do. *If you do not have a SIM card on hands, do NOT set a security code on first boot.*
* When a screen with a loading circle is displayed, just left/right swipe it away.
* If you're not familiar with Sailfish OS, pay attention to the tutorial - the interface works great, but is not immediately obvious. If you are familiar with it, you can skip the tutorial by touching all 4 corners starting top left.

*What works, what does not work*

See the [Hardware Support section](https://wiki.merproject.org/wiki/Adaptations/PinePhone64#Hardware_Support) on the Mer Wiki's PinePhone Page.

There is a limited selection of apps available from the Jolla store, the vast majority are hosted on openrepos.net. If the Storeman app for openrepos is not preinstalled, download the RPM and click to install.

*How to contribute and report defects*

See the documentation wiki at [the github project](https://github.com/sailfish-on-dontbeevil/documentation/wiki) for help and links.

See the [Installation section](https://wiki.merproject.org/wiki/Adaptations/PinePhone64#Installation) on the Mer Wiki's PinePhone Page for compile, build and development.

* [Mer Open Build Service page](https://build.merproject.org/project/show/nemo:devel:hw:pine:dontbeevil) ([Mer is being assimilated into Sailfish OS](https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/changes-needed-to-merge-the-project-names-to-sailfish-os/1672) and [OBS is shutting down](https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/obs-shut-down-and-next-steps/1814), also see [OpenStack is replacing OBS with another build system based on Jenkins](https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/fuel-specs/specs/7.0/replace-obs.html), if it's related, even OBS come back under Sailfish OS, it will be different.)

See the [Sailfish OS wiki](https://sailfishos.org/wiki/Collaborative_Development#Reporting_issues) for links to their forum, as well as info required when reporting an issue. See the [Sailfish OS wiki main page](https://sailfishos.org/wiki/SailfishOS) for options to contribute to Sailfish OS.

*Notes*

OTA is supported: `zypper refresh && zypper update` as root (`devel-su` to get root access). Things that need reflash are bootloader specific at the moment. If improvements like [Crust](/documentation/PinePhone/Software/Crust) or changes of partition layout are added, then you need to reflash.

### Ubuntu Touch

{{< figure src="/documentation/images/Ubports-logo.png" width="100" >}}

A Mobile Version of the Ubuntu Operating System made and maintained by the UBports Community. The port is currently maintained by Oren Klopfer (oklopfer).

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
 Tow-Boot is required for installing the latest version of Ubuntu Touch (20.04) on the PinePhone. Instructions for installing Tow-Boot to the PinePhone can be found [here](https://tow-boot.org/devices/pine64-pinephoneA64.html). 
{{< /admonition >}}

Installation instructions can be found at [this UBports post](https://ubports.com/en/blog/ubports-news-1/post/pinephone-and-pinephone-pro-3889). After Tow-Boot has been installed to your device, Ubuntu Touch installation just requires flashing the _.img.xz_ to an SD or the eMMC.

#### Download

Scroll down to the middle of [the GitLab project page](https://gitlab.com/ook37/pinephone-pro-debos/), or directly here [at the UBports website](https://devices.ubuntu-touch.io/device/pinephone/release/focal/#deviceOverview) to see which features work.

Contributions and bug reports can be made at the [UBports PinePhone GitLab page](https://gitlab.com/ook37/pinephone-pro-debos/). See [UBports website](https://ubports.com/foundation/sponsors) for how to donate.

## Tools

There are software tools, that can be booted on the PinePhone.

### JumpDrive

JumpDrive can be used to flash the eMMC (and the microSD card), see [Installation instructions](/documentation/PinePhone/Installation/Installation_to_the_eMMC/#using_jumpdrive).

See https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive/releases for the latest image.
Make sure to download the "PinePhone" image and to unpack the archive before flashing.

### Tow-Boot

Tow-Boot is a more user-friendly distribution of U-Boot. It can mount internal storage as USB Mass Storage by holding the volume up button at startup before and during the second vibration. The LED will turn blue if done successfully.

See https://github.com/Tow-Boot/Tow-Boot/releases for the latest image.
Make sure to download the image with `pinephoneA64` in the name.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
 The USB Mass Storage mode might not be recognized by your computer for some cable + PC USB port + PC OS combos, see [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PINE64official/comments/unjguw/towboot_doesnt_actually_do_mass_storage_mode/) and [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/Tow-Boot/Tow-Boot/issues/127). If you encounter any problem like this, try use any Linux distro for your PC, or switch USB cables or ports. A patch has been posted on the GitHub issue, try that if you can patch and compile the Tow-Boot yourself, and tell them if that works.

## Hardware test build

{{< admonition type="warning" >}}
 The factorytest image for hardware testing appears to be no longer maintained.
{{< /admonition >}}

On the Braveheart model, there was a postmarketOS based basic Factory Test OS pre-installed on the eMMC. The developer Martijn Braam from postmarketOS has improved the functionality of the image considerably later. Since the 20200501 version, it is able to test all the hardware. It also includes functionality to install a new OS to the eMMC when using with an test image that includes that OS image. The downloadable image just does the hardware tests. Do not flash eMMC to test your device, just flash it to microSD and test from there. New versions are distributed as part of the postmarketOS distribution.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
 The magnetometer test will fail on the new Beta Edition, as the factory image wasn't updated for it yet.

## Historic factory builds

These are different operating system builds that was preloaded in the factory with testing utility.

Download the build, extract the image and dd it to a 8 GB or larger microSD card, then insert it into the PinePhone.
After power up or reboot, you may perform and complete the test routine, or apply the build from microSD card to eMMC.

All the download links below are direct download from pine64.org.

{{< admonition type="warning" >}}
 These images are for testing purposes only. If you are looking for an up-to-date image please select one from the software releases section instead.

## Installing other ARM64 distributions

Other ARM64 distributions might be installed as well, however this requires some tinkering and may not work well.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
Distributions not on this page may not even boot after you follow this section. In the best case, they will be barely usable.
This is more for fun, or if you would like to port a new distribution to the PinePhone.
{{< /admonition >}}

General steps:

1. Create a boot partition (from 4 MB to about 252 MB) and a root partition (from the end of boot to the end of the card) filesystem on the SD card.
2. Format the boot partition with vfat, and the root partition with a supported filesystem like ext4 or f2fs.
3. Extract the root filesystem from your distribution's ARM image into the root filesystem on the SD card. Do not copy the partition, copy the files instead (in archive mode, like `rsync -ar`).
4. Edit `/etc/fstab` to match your partitions.
5. Grab megi's kernel from https://xff.cz/kernels/, Follow the instructions in the [README](https://xff.cz/kernels/README), which involves copying the kernel modules into the SD card rootfs, and writing u-boot and the bootloader.

If you would like to see examples or specific commands for how to complete these steps, see:

* [an example for Arch Linux](https://xnux.eu/howtos/install-arch-linux-arm.html) by megi
