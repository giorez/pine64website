The **Pinebook** is an 11.6″ or 11.6″ with 1080P IPS panel or 14″ notebook powered by the same quad-core ARM Cortex A53 64-Bit Processor used in our popular PINE A64 Single Board Computer. It is very lightweight, hackable and comes equipped with a full-sized keyboard and large multi-touch trackpad. It runs numerous mainline Linux distributions as well as *BSD and Android.
