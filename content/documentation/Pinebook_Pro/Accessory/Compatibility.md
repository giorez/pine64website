Please test as many things as you can find with your Pinebook Pro and share the results here. Some devices which should work don’t!

## Storage

### NVMe SSD drives

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
Please note that this list of compatible M.2 SSDs should be taken with a grain of salt.

In more detail, the output of the 3.3&nbsp;V regulator inside the Pinebook Pro, which powers the M.2 SSD, becomes very noisy when the battery voltage drops below 3.9&nbsp;V or so. This is a hardware issue of the Pinebook Pro that cannot be corrected without extensive hardware modifications, and it causes many M.2 SSDs to lock up under load and cause operating system crashes. The real trouble is that for some M.2 SSDs it takes a couple of hours of heavy I/O to lock up under these conditions, which may make them appear to be working reliably, while they eventually fail.

To test an M.2 SSD properly in a Pinebook Pro, it needs to be put under heavy I/O load for at least two hours in a row, while the Pinebook Pro is running on battery power. Such a long test will also ensure that the battery voltage drops below 3.9&nbsp;V and remains there for the duration of the test. The I/O load can be generated by some simple shell script that copies files over and over, or by building a Linux kernel package used by your Linux distribution. Only if the SSD passes such torture with zero issues, it’s safe to declare it as working reliably in the Pinebook Pro.

To sum it up, an M.2 SSD that qualifies to work reliably in the Pinebook Pro must both consume low amounts of power, 2.5&nbsp;W or less, and be tolerant of the noisy 3.3&nbsp;V power supply. The PINE64 community usually recommends [Intel 660p](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-briefs/660p-series-brief.pdf) M.2 SSDs, 512&nbsp;GB or 1&nbsp;TB variants, which reportedly work well and satisfy both criteria. The 2&nbsp;TB variant of the Intel 660p may be slightly more power hungry.

Additionally, it’s recommended to use an M.2 SSD that supports four PCI Express lanes, which the aforementioned Intel 660p models support. The PCI Express interface of the RK3399 [is limited](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=712fa1777207) to the Gen1 speed, which may cause degraded performance of M.2 SSDs that support fewer than four PCI Express lanes.
{{</ admonition >}}

Only PCI Express M.2 drives can work, due to the available connectivity of the Pinebook Pro. Consequently, SATA or USB M.2 cards will not work.

You need to buy and install the M.2 adapter in order to fit one, please see [Pinebook Pro](/documentation/Pinebook_Pro/Guides/Using-the-optional-NVMe-adapter/)

Please see [a separate section](/documentation/Pinebook_Pro/Troubleshooting#nvme_ssd_issues) that describes reported issues with the NVMe drives in PineBook Pro.

### USB C alternate mode DP

Note that only USB C alternate mode Display Port will pass video. Any HDMI, DVI or VGA port must be converted internally by the device from Display Port - or the device won’t work for video.
