The **PineCam** is a successor to the PineCube IP camera, featuring a refined design and improved specifications. Based on the oz64 single-board computer, it utilizes the SG2000 SoC with dual RISC-V cores and one ARM core, and includes 512MB of RAM to support a full Linux-based OS like MotionEyeOS. 

The device is equipped with a 2MP camera module (GalaxyCore GC02M2) connected via MIPI CSI, and can function as a USB-C wired camera. It features GPIO, a microphone, speaker, and a USB-C power input, with a removable flap for GPIO access.
